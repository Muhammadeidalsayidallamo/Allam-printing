    virtuesBusinessMotivationTitle: 'A Message to Business Owners',
    virtuesBusinessMotivation: "To the owners of wealth and commerce: The assets in your hands are a provision from Allah, and within them lie both a test and a blessing. Zakat and Sadaqa do not decrease wealth; rather, they purify, protect, and increase it. This is your true investment for the hereafter, bringing Allah's barakah into your trade, sustenance, and well-being. Take the initiative to calculate it, and open for yourself doors of goodness that will never close.",
    virtuesHasanahTitle: 'What is the value of a single Hasanah?',
    virtuesHasanahText: `A Hasanah is not a number on a scale, but a light that elevates you with Allah and a treasure saved for you in the Hereafter.
Allah says: "Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for him many times over?"
Every charity you give could be a shield from calamity, a cause for forgiveness, and a seed for a palace in Paradise.
Do not see charity as money that is spent, but as a blessing that returns,
for Allah has promised: "And whatever you spend of anything, He will replace it. And He is the best of providers."`,

    faqQ1: "How are your prices determined?",
    faqA1: "Our prices are not fixed because they vary depending on the type of printing, the number of pieces, the type of fabric, and the design itself. That's why we prefer the customer to contact us to determine the price together via a call or WhatsApp. 📞\n\nYou can call us at +20 101 237 9950, and we will give you the most accurate price for your needs.",
    faqQ2: "What is the minimum quantity for printing?",
    faqA2: "For screen printing, the minimum is 100 pieces. We can print less, but the customer bears the full cost of preparation.\n\nAs for DTF printing, it is by the meter and is suitable for small quantities or special designs.",
    faqQ3: "Do you offer Rubber printing?",
    faqA3: "Yes ✅ We offer high-quality rubber printing, characterized by a smooth matte surface and an elegant touch that gives the design a luxurious and professional look 👕 It's very suitable for brands that want a premium appearance and a stable look with washing and use.\n\nRubber printing is not just about looks... it also gives a strong feel on the fabric and maintains the design details with high precision 💪✨\n\n💰 Its price is slightly higher than regular printing because it requires special inks and precise preparations, but the final result is worth it 👌",
    faqQ4: "Do you offer Puff printing?",
    faqA4: "Absolutely 👌 Puff printing is one of the most distinctive and eye-catching types of printing because it's 3D raised and adds depth to the design. It's very suitable for logos, brands, youth t-shirts, schools, and teams 👕🔥\n\nWe use special materials and inks to maintain the print's elevation and stability with washing, resulting in a professional look that catches the eye from the first time.\n\n💰 Its cost is higher than regular printing due to the use of special materials and precise techniques, but it provides a much higher visual value and professional appearance ✨",
    faqQ5: "Can I order DTF by size or by the meter?",
    faqA5: "Yes, of course. We print DTF by the meter. You can order the size that suits you, whether for your t-shirts or your ready-made product. Pricing is based on the print area and the quality of the film used.",
    faqQ6: "Do you work with individuals or only factories?",
    faqA6: "We primarily serve factories, workshops, offices, shops, brand owners, and ambitious individuals who want to produce a high-quality product. But we also accept orders from individuals who want to print special quantities or a personal design.",
    faqQ7: "Do you provide the material or does the customer bring it?",
    faqA7: "We work as a printing service only, meaning the customer can bring their own material, and we will print on it professionally. If you need material from us, we can provide it according to your desire and the type of project.",
    faqQ8: "Where do you source your materials from?",
    faqA8: "We use the best materials on the market—from excellent Egyptian, to well-crafted Turkish, strong Chinese, and up to luxurious European. We choose the appropriate type with the customer according to the goal, target market, and nature of use. Whether you are printing for a youth design, a work uniform, or a product for a brand, we will provide the material that suits you.",
    faqQ9: "Do you accept the customer's materials?",
    faqA9: "Of course, if you have your own material, we can print on it. But we review it first to ensure it is suitable for printing and will not be affected by heat or ink.",
    faqQ10: "How does delivery work?",
    faqA10: "We have a clear delivery system:\n- If a regular customer prints over 500 pieces, delivery is completely on us.\n- If the quantity is from 210 to 500 pieces, we split the delivery cost (half on us, half on the customer).\n- If the order is less than 210 pieces, the customer bears the full delivery cost.\n\nWe use reliable shipping companies and always inform you of the delivery date a day in advance.",
    faqQ11: "How long does delivery take?",
    faqA11: "Usually from 2 to 5 business days depending on the quantity and type of printing. If the quantity is large or requires special preparation, we will inform you of the date at the time of agreement. If you are in a hurry, we try to facilitate as much as possible and make it a priority.",
    faqQ12: "Is there a warranty on the printing?",
    faqA12: "Of course, all our work has a quality guarantee against any problem in printing or color fixation. We review every piece before delivery, and if there is any problem, we take full responsibility and refund you immediately.",
    faqQ13: "How long does the print last with washing?",
    faqA13: "It lasts a very long time 💪 as long as the product is washed correctly (lukewarm water, turn the piece inside out, no direct ironing on the print). Because we use original inks and high-quality thermal materials.",
    faqQ14: "Is there a sample before execution?",
    faqA14: "We can make a sample print for large orders before starting production, to ensure quality and colors.",
    faqQ15: "Can I print my personal design?",
    faqA15: "Of course, send us your design (preferably in high-quality PNG or PDF format), and we will prepare it for printing correctly. If you need minor adjustments, our design team can help you.",
    faqQ16: "What if I don't have a ready design?",
    faqA16: "We provide a professional design service. We can turn your idea or logo into a high-quality, ready-to-print file.",
    faqQ17: "Are there discounts for large quantities?",
    faqA17: "Of course, we offer special discounts for factories and brands that print continuously or in large quantities. The larger the quantity, the lower the price, because the cost is distributed over a larger number of pieces.",
    faqQ18: "What payment methods are available?",
    faqA18: "We accept several payment methods to facilitate for customers: 💵 Cash, 💳 Instapay, 📱 Vodafone Cash, 🏦 Bank Transfer, 🌐 WePay or any available electronic means by agreement.",

    faqQ20: "What if there is a delay or a problem with the printing?",
    faqA20: "We always adhere to deadlines, but if an unexpected circumstance occurs, we will inform you immediately. Most importantly: if there is any problem with quality or execution, we take full responsibility and compensate you immediately.",
    faqQ21: "Does the print fade over time?",
    faqA21: "Not at all 👕 as long as the product is washed correctly, the print remains very stable and intact even after years of use.",

    faqA22: "Very simple 👇\n1️⃣ Fill out the 'Request a Quote' form on the website.\n2️⃣ Wait for a call from our team.\n3️⃣ We determine the price, type of material, and delivery date together.\n\nAnd from here your experience with Allam Printing begins—quality that speaks for itself 🎨✨",
    faqQ23: "Can I monitor the operation myself or send someone from my side?",
    faqA23: "Of course, we always welcome transparency 👌 If you have a large order, you can come yourself or send a representative from your factory to monitor the operation and quality during printing. Our team is keen that the customer is assured that every step is proceeding as agreed. Our goal is for you to see for yourself that the quality we promised is 100% real.",
    faqQ24: "What is your production capacity like?",
    faqA24: "Alhamdulillah, we have a very organized operating system built on speed and quality at the same time 👕 In screen printing, a single machine produces approximately 440 pieces per shift (8 hours) for a 3-color design. If you have large quantities or need faster delivery, we can increase the operation by opening a second shift or running more than one machine by agreement.\n\nAs for DTF printing, our production reaches up to 15 meters per hour, which allows us to prepare your designs with very high quality and in record time, even if they have many colors or fine details.\n\nThe most important thing for us is that the work comes out with consistent quality, calculated speed, and on-time delivery, because we believe that the customer does not need to hear promises... he needs to see results on the ground 🔥",
    faqQ25: "What if the design has a lot of colors, is screen printing suitable?",
    faqA25: "If the number of colors is very large, we recommend DTF because it's more accurate and cost-effective in these cases, but we can execute it with screen printing depending on the nature of the job.",
    faqQ26: "Do you print on finished products or only on fabric?",
    faqA26: "We can print on fabric before sewing or on finished products like t-shirts, sweatshirts, bags, tablecloths, etc.",

    faqA27: "We prefer the design to be high resolution (300 DPI) and in actual dimensions according to the printing location. Our team can help you prepare the appropriate dimensions.",
    faqQ28: "How do you handle very small or very large designs?",
    faqA28: "We adjust the size according to the piece and the printing location, and we inform you if any adjustment is necessary before execution.",
    faqQ29: "Can I print on both sides (front and back)?",
    faqA29: "Yes, we print on both sides, and the cost is calculated based on the area and number of colors on each side.",
    faqQ30: "Are there different types of heat transfer printing?",
    faqA30: "Yes, we have DTF, Flex, Sublimation, and heat transfer foil, and each type has its appropriate use depending on the design and material.",
    faqQ31: "What if the design has color gradients?",
    faqA31: "DTF is the most suitable for designs with gradients or photographic images because it prints them with high precision.",

    faqA32: "Yes, we have special fluorescent and metallic inks (gold - silver - copper) that give a very distinctive look to the design.",

    faqA35: "The customer must bear the responsibility for the design rights, and we only execute after confirming they have the right to use it.",
    faqQ36: "Do you keep the design after execution?",
    faqA36: "We keep the designs for a period to facilitate reprinting in the future, unless the customer requests otherwise.",
    faqQ37: "What if I want to reprint the same design after a while?",
    faqA37: "No problem, we can print the same design with the same quality without additional preparation costs if the file is saved with us.",
    faqQ38: "Do you provide packaging for the products after printing?",
    faqA38: "Yes, we can provide simple or professional packaging upon your request (individual bags - brand packaging - stickers).",
    faqQ39: "Can I order t-shirts with different names (like a team or school)?",

    faqQ41: "Do you offer paid sample printing for small quantities?",
    faqA41: "We can make you a paid sample, and if you proceed with the quantity afterward, we will deduct the sample cost from the total.",
    faqQ42: "What if I want to change the design after you've started printing?",
    faqA42: "If the change is before the execution phase, there is no problem. But if we have actually started printing, there will be an additional cost depending on the stage.",
    faqQ43: "Are there certain colors that might differ in the final result?",
    faqA43: "Some neon or metallic colors differ depending on the type of fabric, and our team will inform you of any expected differences before execution.",

    faqA44: "Yes, you can look at material samples before choosing the most suitable for your project.",
    faqQ45: "Do prices change if the quantity is divided into different sizes?",
    faqA45: "No, sizes do not affect the price as long as the design is the same. What affects it is the number of designs and print colors.",
    faqQ46: "Do you offer tag printing inside the neck for brands?",
    faqA46: "Yes, we provide tag printing inside the neck with the logo, size, and instructions, which gives a professional look to the product.",
    faqQ47: "Do you also offer tailoring services or just printing?",
    faqA47: "Our main service is printing, but we can recommend reliable tailoring workshops if you need one.",
    faqQ48: "What if there is a problem from the customer's side (unsuitable material or unclear design)?",
    faqA48: "We inform the customer before execution, and if they insist, we proceed at their responsibility, and we write this in the work order to avoid any confusion.",
    faqQ49: "Can I order printing on a regular basis (monthly or seasonal)?",
    faqA49: "Yes, we can set up a regular supply system for you according to your schedule, whether monthly, seasonal, or on-demand.",

    faqQ8: "من أين تحصلون على خاماتكم؟",
    faqA8: "نستخدم أفضل الخامات في السوق—من المصري الممتاز، إلى التركي المتقن، الصيني القوي، وصولًا إلى الأوروبي الفاخر. نختار النوع المناسب مع العميل حسب الهدف، السوق المستهدف، وطبيعة الاستخدام. سواء كنت تطبع لتصميم شبابي، يونيفورم عمل، أو منتج لبراند، سنوفر الخامة التي تليق بك.",
    faqQ9: "هل تقبلون خامات العميل؟",

    faqA10: "لدينا نظام توصيل واضح:\n- إذا طبع عميل دائم أكثر من 500 قطعة 👉 التوصيل علينا بالكامل.\n- إذا كانت الكمية من 210 إلى 500 قطعة 👉 نتقاسم تكلفة التوصيل (النصف علينا، والنصف على العميل).\n- إذا كان الطلب أقل من 210 قطعة 👉 يتحمل العميل تكلفة التوصيل كاملة.\n\nنستخدم شركات شحن موثوقة ونبلغك دائمًا بموعد التسليم قبلها بيوم.",

    faqA11: "عادةً من 2 إلى 5 أيام عمل حسب الكمية ونوع الطباعة. إذا كانت الكمية كبيرة أو تتطلب تحضيرًا خاصًا، نبلغك بالموعد وقت الاتفاق. إذا كنت مستعجلاً، نحاول تسهيل الأمر قدر الإمكان وجعله أولوية.",
    faqQ12: "هل هناك ضمان على الطباعة؟",
    faqA12: "بالطبع، كل شغلنا عليه ضمان جودة ضد أي مشكلة في الطباعة أو ثبات اللون. نراجع كل قطعة قبل التسليم، وإذا كان هناك أي مشكلة، نتحمل المسؤولية كاملة ونعوضك فورًا.",
    faqQ13: "كم تدوم الطباعة مع الغسيل؟",
    faqA13: "تدوم طويلاً جدًا 💪 طالما يتم غسل المنتج بشكل صحيح (ماء فاتر، قلب القطعة، عدم الكي المباشر على الطباعة). لأننا نستخدم أحبارًا أصلية ومواد حرارية عالية الجودة.",

    faqA17: "بالطبع، نقدم خصومات خاصة للمصانع والبراندات التي تطبع بشكل مستمر أو بكميات كبيرة. كلما زادت الكمية، قل السعر، لأن التكلفة تتوزع على عدد أكبر من القطع.",
    faqQ18: "ما هي طرق الدفع المتاحة؟",
    faqA18: "نقبل عدة طرق دفع لتسهيل الأمر على العملاء: 💵 كاش، 💳 انستا باي، 📱 فودافون كاش، 🏦 تحويل بنكي، 🌐 وي باي أو أي وسيلة إلكترونية متاحة بالاتفاق.",

    faqQ24: "كيف هي طاقتكم الإنتاجية؟",
    faqA24: "الحمد لله، لدينا نظام تشغيل منظم جدًا مبني على السرعة والجودة في نفس الوقت 👕 في طباعة السلك سكرين، الماكينة الواحدة تنتج حوالي 440 قطعة في الوردية (8 ساعات) لتصميم 3 ألوان. إذا كان لديك كميات كبيرة أو تحتاج تسليم أسرع، يمكننا زيادة التشغيل بفتح وردية ثانية أو تشغيل أكثر من ماكينة بالاتفاق.\n\nأما طباعة DTF، فإنتاجنا يصل إلى 15 مترًا في الساعة، مما يسمح لنا بتجهيز تصميماتك بجودة عالية جدًا وفي وقت قياسي، حتى لو كانت ألوانها كثيرة أو تفاصيلها دقيقة.\n\nالأهم بالنسبة لنا أن يخرج الشغل بجودة ثابتة، وسرعة محسوبة، وتسليم في الموعد، لأننا نؤمن أن العميل لا يحتاج أن يسمع وعودًا... يحتاج أن يرى نتائج على أرض الواقع 🔥",
    faqQ25: "ماذا لو كان التصميم يحتوي على ألوان كثيرة، هل طباعة السلك سكرين مناسبة؟",

    faqQ43: "هل هناك ألوان معينة قد تختلف في النتيجة النهائية؟",
    faqA43: "بعض الألوان النيون أو المعدنية تختلف حسب نوع القماش، وسيقوم فريقنا بإبلاغك بأي اختلافات متوقعة قبل التنفيذ.",
    faqQ44: "هل توفرون عينات من القماش قبل الطباعة؟",

Verdiğiniz her sadaka, bir beladan korunma, bir mağfiret sebebi ve Cennette bir köşk tohumu olabilir.

    faqQ1: "Fiyatlarınız nasıl belirleniyor?",
    faqA1: "Fiyatlarımız sabit değildir çünkü baskı türüne, parça sayısına, kumaş türüne ve tasarımın kendisine göre değişir. Bu yüzden müşterinin bir arama veya WhatsApp aracılığıyla fiyatı birlikte belirlemek için bizimle iletişime geçmesini tercih ediyoruz. 📞\n\nBizi +20 101 237 9950 numaralı telefondan arayabilirsiniz, size ihtiyaçlarınız için en doğru fiyatı vereceğiz.",
    faqQ2: "Baskı için minimum miktar nedir?",
    faqA2: "Serigrafi baskı için minimum 100 adettir. Daha az basabiliriz, ancak müşteri hazırlık maliyetinin tamamını karşılar.\n\nDTF baskı ise metre ile yapılır ve küçük miktarlar veya özel tasarımlar için uygundur.",
    faqQ3: "Kauçuk baskı sunuyor musunuz?",
    faqA3: "Evet ✅ Tasarıma lüks ve profesyonel bir görünüm kazandıran pürüzsüz mat yüzeyi ve zarif dokunuşuyla karakterize edilen yüksek kaliteli kauçuk baskı sunuyoruz 👕 Premium bir görünüm ve yıkama ve kullanımla sabit bir görünüm isteyen markalar için çok uygundur.\n\nKauçuk baskı sadece görünümle ilgili değildir... aynı zamanda kumaş üzerinde güçlü bir his verir ve tasarım ayrıntılarını yüksek hassasiyetle korur 💪✨\n\n💰 Özel mürekkepler ve hassas hazırlıklar gerektirdiği için fiyatı normal baskıdan biraz daha yüksektir, ancak nihai sonuç buna değer 👌",
    faqQ4: "Kabartma (Puff) baskı sunuyor musunuz?",
    faqA4: "Kesinlikle 👌 Kabartma baskı, 3D kabartmalı olduğu ve tasarıma derinlik kattığı için en belirgin ve göz alıcı baskı türlerinden biridir. Logolar, markalar, gençlik tişörtleri, okullar ve takımlar için çok uygundur 👕🔥\n\nYıkama ile baskının kabarıklığını ve stabilitesini korumak için özel malzemeler ve mürekkepler kullanıyoruz, bu da ilk andan itibaren göz alıcı profesyonel bir görünümle sonuçlanıyor.\n\n💰 Özel malzemeler ve hassas teknikler kullanılması nedeniyle maliyeti normal baskıdan daha yüksektir, ancak çok daha yüksek bir görsel değer ve profesyonel bir görünüm sağlar ✨",
    faqQ5: "DTF'yi boyuta göre mi yoksa metreye göre mi sipariş edebilirim?",
    faqA5: "Evet, tabii ki. DTF'yi metre ile basıyoruz. Tişörtleriniz veya hazır ürününüz için size uygun boyutu sipariş edebilirsiniz. Fiyatlandırma baskı alanına ve kullanılan filmin kalitesine göre yapılır.",
    faqQ6: "Bireylerle mi yoksa sadece fabrikalarla mı çalışıyorsunuz?",
    faqA6: "Öncelikle fabrikalara, atölyelere, ofislere, mağazalara, marka sahiplerine ve yüksek kaliteli bir ürün üretmek isteyen hırslı bireylere hizmet veriyoruz. Ancak özel miktarlarda veya kişisel bir tasarımda baskı yapmak isteyen bireylerden de sipariş kabul ediyoruz.",
    faqQ7: "Malzemeyi siz mi sağlıyorsunuz yoksa müşteri mi getiriyor?",
    faqA7: "Sadece bir baskı hizmeti olarak çalışıyoruz, yani müşteri kendi malzemesini getirebilir ve biz de profesyonelce üzerine baskı yaparız. Bizden malzeme ihtiyacınız olursa, isteğinize ve projenin türüne göre sağlayabiliriz.",
    faqQ8: "Malzemelerinizi nereden temin ediyorsunuz?",
    faqA8: "Piyasadaki en iyi malzemeleri kullanıyoruz—mükemmel Mısır, iyi işlenmiş Türk, güçlü Çin ve lüks Avrupa'ya kadar. Müşteri ile birlikte amaca, hedef pazara ve kullanım doğasına göre uygun türü seçiyoruz. İster bir gençlik tasarımı, ister bir iş üniforması veya bir marka için bir ürün baskısı yapıyor olun, size uygun malzemeyi sağlayacağız.",
    faqQ9: "Müşterinin malzemelerini kabul ediyor musunuz?",
    faqA9: "Elbette, kendi malzemeniz varsa üzerine baskı yapabiliriz. Ancak baskıya uygun olduğundan ve ısıdan veya mürekkepten etkilenmeyeceğinden emin olmak için önce onu inceleriz.",
    faqQ10: "Teslimat nasıl işliyor?",
    faqA10: "Açık bir teslimat sistemimiz var:\n- Eğer düzenli bir müşteri 500'den fazla parça bastırırsa, teslimat tamamen bize aittir.\n- Miktar 210 ile 500 parça arasındaysa, teslimat maliyetini paylaşıyoruz (yarısı bizden, yarısı müşteriden).\n- Sipariş 210 parçadan az ise, müşteri tüm teslimat maliyetini karşılar.\n\nGüvenilir nakliye şirketleri kullanıyoruz ve teslimat tarihini her zaman bir gün önceden size bildiriyoruz.",
    faqQ11: "Teslimat ne kadar sürer?",
    faqA11: "Genellikle miktar ve baskı türüne bağlı olarak 2 ila 5 iş günü. Miktar büyükse veya özel hazırlık gerektiriyorsa, anlaşma sırasında size tarihi bildireceğiz. Aceleniz varsa, mümkün olduğunca kolaylaştırmaya ve öncelik haline getirmeye çalışırız.",
    faqQ12: "Baskıda garanti var mı?",
    faqA12: "Elbette, tüm işlerimizin baskı veya renk sabitlemesinde herhangi bir soruna karşı kalite garantisi vardır. Teslimattan önce her parçayı inceliyoruz ve herhangi bir sorun varsa, tam sorumluluğu üstleniyor ve sizi hemen iade ediyoruz.",
    faqQ13: "Baskı yıkama ile ne kadar dayanır?",
    faqA13: "Çok uzun süre dayanır 💪 ürün doğru şekilde yıkandığı sürece (ılık su, parçayı ters çevirin, baskının üzerine doğrudan ütü yapmayın). Çünkü orijinal mürekkepler ve yüksek kaliteli termal malzemeler kullanıyoruz.",
    faqQ14: "Uygulamadan önce bir örnek var mı?",
    faqA14: "Kalite ve renkleri sağlamak için üretime başlamadan önce büyük siparişler için bir baskı örneği yapabiliriz.",
    faqQ15: "Kişisel tasarımımı bastırabilir miyim?",
    faqA15: "Elbette, tasarımınızı bize gönderin (tercihen yüksek kaliteli PNG veya PDF formatında) ve baskı için doğru şekilde hazırlayacağız. Küçük ayarlamalara ihtiyacınız olursa, tasarım ekibimiz size yardımcı olabilir.",
    faqQ16: "Hazır bir tasarımım yoksa ne olur?",
    faqA16: "Profesyonel bir tasarım hizmeti sunuyoruz. Fikrinizi veya logonuzu yüksek kaliteli, baskıya hazır bir dosyaya dönüştürebiliriz.",
    faqQ17: "Büyük miktarlar için indirim var mı?",
    faqA17: "Elbette, sürekli veya büyük miktarlarda baskı yapan fabrikalar ve markalar için özel indirimler sunuyoruz. Miktar ne kadar büyük olursa, fiyat o kadar düşük olur, çünkü maliyet daha fazla sayıda parçaya dağıtılır.",
    faqQ18: "Hangi ödeme yöntemleri mevcut?",
    faqA18: "Müşterileri kolaylaştırmak için çeşitli ödeme yöntemlerini kabul ediyoruz: 💵 Nakit, 💳 Instapay, 📱 Vodafone Cash, 🏦 Banka Havalesi, 🌐 WePay veya anlaşma ile mevcut herhangi bir elektronik araç.",

    faqQ21: "Baskı zamanla solar mı?",
    faqA21: "Hiç de değil 👕 ürün doğru şekilde yıkandığı sürece, baskı yıllar süren kullanımdan sonra bile çok sağlam ve bozulmamış kalır.",
    faqQ22: "Nasıl sipariş verebilirim?",
    faqA22: "Çok basit 👇\n1️⃣ Web sitesindeki 'Teklif İste' formunu doldurun.\n2️⃣ Ekibimizden bir arama bekleyin.\n3️⃣ Fiyatı, malzeme türünü ve teslimat tarihini birlikte belirliyoruz.\n\nVe buradan Allam Baskı ile deneyiminiz başlıyor—kendini anlatan kalite 🎨✨",
    faqQ23: "Operasyonu kendim denetleyebilir miyim veya tarafımdan birini gönderebilir miyim?",
    faqA23: "Elbette, şeffaflığı her zaman memnuniyetle karşılıyoruz 👌 Büyük bir siparişiniz varsa, baskı sırasında operasyonu ve kaliteyi denetlemek için kendiniz gelebilir veya fabrikanızdan bir temsilci gönderebilirsiniz. Ekibimiz, müşterinin her adımın anlaşıldığı gibi ilerlediğinden emin olmasını sağlamaya özen gösterir. Amacımız, söz verdiğimiz kalitenin %100 gerçek olduğunu kendi gözlerinizle görmenizdir.",
    faqQ24: "Üretim kapasiteniz nasıl?",
    faqA24: "Elhamdülillah, aynı anda hız ve kalite üzerine kurulu çok organize bir işletim sistemimiz var 👕 Serigrafi baskıda, tek bir makine 3 renkli bir tasarım için bir vardiyada (8 saat) yaklaşık 440 parça üretir. Büyük miktarlarınız varsa veya daha hızlı teslimata ihtiyacınız varsa, ikinci bir vardiya açarak veya anlaşma ile birden fazla makine çalıştırarak operasyonu artırabiliriz.\n\nDTF baskıya gelince, üretimimiz saatte 15 metreye kadar ulaşır, bu da tasarımlarınızı çok sayıda renk veya ince ayrıntı içerse bile çok yüksek kalitede ve rekor sürede hazırlamamızı sağlar.\n\nBizim için en önemli şey, işin tutarlı kalitede, hesaplanmış hızda ve zamanında teslimatla çıkmasıdır, çünkü müşterinin vaatler duymaya değil... sahada sonuçlar görmeye ihtiyacı olduğuna inanıyoruz 🔥",
    faqQ25: "Tasarımda çok fazla renk varsa, serigrafi baskı uygun mudur?",
    faqA25: "Renk sayısı çok fazlaysa, bu durumlarda daha doğru ve uygun maliyetli olduğu için DTF'yi öneririz, ancak işin niteliğine göre serigrafi baskı ile de uygulayabiliriz.",
    faqQ26: "Bitmiş ürünlere mi yoksa sadece kumaşa mı baskı yapıyorsunuz?",

    faqQ31: "Tasarımda renk geçişleri varsa ne olur?",

    faqA36: "Müşteri aksini talep etmedikçe, gelecekte yeniden basımı kolaylaştırmak için tasarımları bir süre saklıyoruz.",
    faqQ37: "Bir süre sonra aynı tasarımı yeniden bastırmak istersem ne olur?",

    faqA42: "Değişiklik uygulama aşamasından önce ise sorun olmaz. Ancak baskıya gerçekten başladıysak, aşamaya bağlı olarak ek bir maliyet olacaktır.",
    faqQ43: "Nihai sonuçta farklı olabilecek belirli renkler var mı?",

    faqQ44: "Baskıdan önce kumaş örnekleri sağlıyor musunuz?",
    faqA44: "Evet, projeniz için en uygun olanı seçmeden önce malzeme örneklerine bakabilirsiniz.",
    faqQ45: "Miktar farklı boyutlara bölünürse fiyatlar değişir mi?",
    faqA45: "Hayır, tasarım aynı olduğu sürece boyutlar fiyatı etkilemez. Etkileyen şey tasarım sayısı ve baskı renkleridir.",
    faqQ46: "Markalar için boyun içine etiket baskısı sunuyor musunuz?",

Chaque aumône que vous donnez peut être un bouclier contre une calamité, une cause de pardon et la graine d'un palais au Paradis.
